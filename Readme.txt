Multi Regional, Time Step, and Technology Economic Dispatch


----------------------------------------------
The following code is a Linear Programming (LP) optimization for a multi región, technology, and time step dispatch problem. It is implemented using PYOMO. This was a part of the Article "A Methodology for the Identification of Key Factors in Power System Planning: The Case of Mexico"

How to run the program:

- Install PYOMO.
- Unzip Optim.zip folder and copy the folder contents to the root directory.
- Open Multi_Reg_ED.py in Spyder using Anaconda or any other suitable platform.
- Capacity, Costs, Demand, and Transmission área input templates. You can modify the parameters of availability factors, installed capacity, maximum transmission capacity, technology costs, and demand.
- Run it.
- Results of the optimization process can be analyzed in the TemplateResults.xlsx file.
